# Ghostty Config

This is my personal configuration for [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/).

> Ghostty is a terminal emulator that differentiates itself by being fast, feature-rich, and native. While there are many excellent terminal emulators available, they all force you to choose between speed, features, or native UIs. Ghostty provides all three.
